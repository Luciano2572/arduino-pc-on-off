#notepad++
This project is the result in a need of turning on the computer remotely.
In essence, it's a relay to act as the power button on the computer connected to an Arduino UNO, which connects to the internet thru a W5100 ethernet shield.
I have from there added a few extras and made this device fit in a 5.25 enclosure to put in the computer, taken from an old dvd drive.
Features:

- Support to a physical power button
- 14x2 LCD Display to show status & last used option
- Uses a W5100 ethernet shield for connectivity
- Relay to trigger the pwr_switch computer line
